		<h2>Description</h2>
		</header>
			<article>
				<p>My final website will be based on a project that I've been doing for my Interactive/ Web Design 1 class. The theme that I chose is "How to Survive an Apocalypse" and it is basically a funny approach to serious matters so that people can feel comfortable discussing them.</p> 
				<p>The website will display tips and instructions on how to survive an apocalypse. This theme is actually an excuse to introduce basic survival skills and teach people how to act in emergency situations. The idea behind it is that if someone could survive different kinds of apocalypses, they would be ready for any kind of emergency situation that could happen. The more people are prepared for those kind of situations, less is the damage caused to everyone involved.</p>
				<p>Even though There are some companies who are engaged on the same theme, the website would be controlled by an imaginary company.</p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		</header>
			<article>
				<p>When it comes to thinking about emergencies, people tend to get really scared. Sometimes controlling your nerves and having background information are the key to surviving certain situations. </p>
				<p>This website could help people be informed about how to act whenever an odd situation occurs. For example, if the message of the website is transmitted successfully, the rates of simple accidents would be lower and also, there would be less people injured or damaged.</p>		
				<p>The website would also transmit all the information in a funny and interesting way, which can help making people more interested in the theme and, consequently, making the message easier  to remember.</p>
				<p>In other words, my main objectives are:</p>
				<li>Give people the resources and information they need for surviving an emergency situation;</li>
				<li>Gather tips from different sources for possible life or death situations in one web space;</li>
				<li>Display important information in a way that people become interested;</li>
				<li>Spread the information to as many people as possible.</li>
			</article>

		<h2>Content</h2>
		</header>
			<article>
				<p>The website will be a platform that gathers relevant information from different sources such as social institutions, police departments, health associations, scouts teams, etc.</p>
				<p>Since it is meant to provide information and instructions, the site will be organized as if it was a guide: minimalistic and direct. The visuals will stimulate the user to keep calm and be rational, but with a touch of fun.</p>
				<p>Interesting graphic elements, illustrations and videos displaying the actions described will be incorporated. The reason for that is to make the experience easier to remember and also to attract more viewers.</p>	
				<p>The structure will be divided in four sections that will be displayed as a one page website. The sections are: Home (about the page), Apocalypses (with specific tips for situations related to aliens, titans and zombies), Survival Tips (general tips for emergencies) and Contact.</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		</header>
			<article>
				<p>I came across some websites that had similar proposal as mine. In the end, they were all too fictitious and the situations didn't to the real world. However, the fact that they were all engaged in describing a situation with imaginary characters inspired me to use fictional monsters to represent all the bad things that could happen in the world.</p>
				<p>Some examples and comments:</p>
				<li>"How to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse": use of vibrating colors that could make the reader unquiet, instead of controlled. Visual and layout decisions that make the reading difficult and unreliable.</li>
				<p><img src="images/zombies.png" alt="zombies">
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Tips provided by social organizations: usually related to only one theme. Content presented in a dense text and without any visual resource that would help making the information more intuitive.</li>
				<br>
				<p><img src="images/social_organizations.png" alt="org">
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Scattered post on blogs: generic and incomplete information. No use of visual elements to represent and illustrate the information.</li>
				<br>
				<p><img src="images/blogs.png" alt="blogs">
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>"Dumb Ways to Die": smart and funny approach. Style of illustration making the situations look less aggressive. The message is simple and clear. "The more people that watch the video or listen to the song, the less accidents we'll have and the happier we'll all be."</li>

		<h3>What can I do better?</h3>
		</header>
			<article>
				<li>Make the texts clearer and more direct;</li>
				<li>Use graphic elements, illustrations and videos to illustrate the situations;</li>
				<li>Gather as many different situations as I can;</li>
				<li>Create an usability that stimulates the user to explore the website.</li>
			</article>

		<h2>Audience</h2>
		</header>
			<article>
				<p>The end user would be any person who is interested in tips for all kinds of weird situations. The more the website is shown to everyone, more people will be ready to deal with life or death situations. The website will also provide basic knowledge for survival in everyday-life situations.</p>

		<h3>Color Palette</h3>
		</header>
			<article>
			    <p>I wanted to have a strong color to make a statement and caught people's attention. I chose Yellow because it's a vibrant color but not as aggressive as red for example. To make it remain looking like a guide, all the other colors are neutral and calm. The sections of specific apocalypses will have a different main related to their causes (aliens, titans and zombies).</p>
